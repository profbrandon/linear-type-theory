OPEN:

[ ] Implement Term over Type abstraction

[ ] Redefine the recursors to be constants using dependent types.

[ ] When loading problem1.ltt, the parser (possibly something else) takes a long time in loading the file.

[ ] When running the judgements given in problem2.ltt, there is a long delay between start and completion.

[ ] Figure out how to (in some sense) lower types to the level of terms in order to do definitions, normalization, typing, etc.


CLOSED:

[X] Allows unbound type variables.


[X] \x : I. * @ * typechecks

[X] Won't parse if there is terminating whitespace.

[X] Problem with alpha equivalence and eta-reducible terms. (It turned out that this was a related problem to the acceptable arguments
    problem in which arrow types were incorrectly declared different.)

[X] Add Pi-Types and remove linear implication, making linear implication an instance of Pi-Types. 

[X] Finish alpha-equivalence for determining which types are acceptable as arguments. (This turned out to not need alpha-equivalence.
    Instead, it required checking if "I -+ I" is equal to "I -+ I" for example, since their internal Pi-strings may not match.)

[X] Fix the problem with "Normal." I suspect that it has to do with the parser since it is occuring before the "File loaded" message
    is displayed.

[X] Add universes to the collection of primitives and implement the associated functionality.

[X] Free variables function
